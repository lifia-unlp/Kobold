# Kobold Accessibility Package
Accessibility tool as a service for web applications. Development version

 <!---
## Overview
Kobold scans your web app's real users' activity to search for usability smells. When you check the reports, Kobold will recommend you to take action by applying usability refactorings. In some cases, you'll be able to apply automatically generated refactorings for you.

 
## Research
Kobold was developed at LIFIA (UNLP, Argentina) research labs. Read more about it:
